        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        
        <p>
            A molecular biologist and a Bioinformatics enthusiast with Master's Degree in Genetics and a Bachelor’s Degree in Microbiology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shortly after my graduation, I was able to get admittance for an internship opportunity at the United States Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya. The six-month internship equipped me with Molecular Biology techniques which have continually helped me to obtain high quality results in different biological assays.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main role at USAMRU-K entailed a continuous surveillance and mapping of Leishmaniasis from endemic regions such as Baringo, Kenya, as well as genetic variation surveillance of the Leishmaniasis-causing pathogens, Leishmania major and Leishmania donovani. Other assays included DNA/RNA Extraction (Spectrophotometric/fluorometric concentration measurements) and PCR & Gel Electrophoresis (Primer design, PCR/RT-PCR, gel-staining) during Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) Surveillance Study to catalogue fever causing pathogens and HIV/Malaria Co-Infection Study in determining HIV positive patients that are carriers of the malaria parasite using molecular techniques. These assays were key in informing disease patterns around study regions and their combat strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have also been a bioinformatics intern at International Center for Insect Physiology (ICIPE) Research center. The Molecular Biology Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit (MBBU) hub housed within ICIPE was very instrumental in introducing me to new Molecular Biology research concepts such as Next Generation Sequencing and use of computational tools to analyze biological data. Among key techniques include application of programming languages such as Python and R, biostatistics and genomic data analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an intern, I did light programming and scripting to create workflows that involve genetic material data analysis. This was accomplished through various programming languages such as Bash, Python and R. Towards the end of my internship at <a href="http://www.icipe.org/research/research-support-units/molecular-biology-bioinformatics-and-biostatistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MBBU-ICIPE</a>, - together with my teammate, I worked on End to End 16S rRNA data analysis pipeline with two most popular analysis tools available today (QIIME2 and DADA2). The end goal of this project was to provide analysis pipelines for similar data generated at ICIPE laboratories in support for the kind of scientific research that occurs at ICIPE. From a novice programming-languages-user, I am more comfortable in aspects that involve generation of data (from the wetlab) to its analysis (computational biology).
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            I also developed other skills from various other activities in the laboratory from previous student attachment periods at Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) which included; DNA Sequencing (sanger/nextgen sequencing (Illumina Sequencing)/data analysis), 100% Inventory taking and subsequent Data Entry to account for all samples in the database, Molecular Biology Techniques such as PCR, Cloning, Molecular Engineering and ELISA, Cellular Cultures (Culture and Sensitivity of microbiological samples) and Biochemical Tests and Malaria RDTs including Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP Techniques).
        </p>

        <p>
            It is the amalgamation of these techniques that make me the Molecular Biologist I am today. Currently I am a Masters Student at Sao Paulo State University, pursuing Masters in Genetics.Away from the laboratory, I have great leadership skills, able to take initiative and enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee.

            <h3>Dissertation</h3>

            <p>
                Generation of T. cruzi strains knock-out for IP6K and evaluation of homologous recombination (HR) repair capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Tritrypanosomatids; Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei sp and Leishmania spp are one of the most important disease-causing agents. These parasites are responsible for Chagas disease, African sleeping sickness and Leishmaniasis respectively and constitute for thousands of deaths annually around the world. There tritryps employ Homologous Recombination to generate genetic variability which increases successfully the  rates of infection through increased surface molecules diversity. HR is a complex system of pathways that repairs DNA lesions, primarily the Double Stranded Breaks (DSBs) introduced in the tritrpy’s DNA when these agents are attacked by the mammalian immune system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent studies have reported new key players, phosphoinositol pyrophosphates (PPIPs), that have an important role in eukaryotic HR repair pathways. These studies have demonstrated stalled HR activity in cells that lack the IP6K which is responsible for the phosphorylation of IP6 to IP7 and subsequently phosphorylation of IP7 to IP8 through PP-IP5K. Despite their discovery more than 20 years ago, little is known about the mechanisms of involvement of the PP-IPs in HR in most of the eukaryotic model organisms. T. cruzi, therefore, is an excellent study organism to help further understand the involvement of PP-IPs during HR in tritrypanosomatids.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this study, T. cruzi IP6K KO CL-Brener strains are used to assess the participation of PP-IPs in HR. The study employs use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate IP6K KO strains which are challenged with Ionization Radiation to induce DSBs. Characterization analysis of IP6K KO, IP6K add-back and WT is done to establish the genotypes of these lineages. The add-back approach is explored as a control so as to demonstrate the specificity of the assay and eliminate any bias due to possible off-targets. The growth curves are then done to observe the proliferation pattern of all lineages after IR treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                The recruitment kinetics for HR repair pathways are established and compared if the DNA damage responses are different. The DNA repair kinetics by HR are analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blot using antibodies to identify the presence of phosphorylated histone H2A (γH2A), RPA-1, and the HR key component Rad51. Proteomic analysis of the T. cruzi linegaes generated using mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to understand the role of PPIPs in HR DNA repair pathways. A further scRNA-Seq analysis is done so as to establish the involvement of PPIP kinases in HR not previously predicted.
